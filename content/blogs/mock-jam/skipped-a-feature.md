# Why I Didn’t Let Users Rate Themselves on MockJam

When I first launched MockJam, someone asked me, “Why not let users rate their own performance after each mock?”

It seemed like a reasonable idea. Self-reflection is a part of learning. A simple 1–5 star scale or a few tags like “good structure” or “jumped to solution” could give users a sense of progress.

But I didn’t add it - and it was a conscious decision.

## What Looked Like a Feature Was Actually a Trap

At first glance, self-rating sounds like a helpful layer:

- It encourages reflection.
- It gives the user a sense of control.
- It could help personalize future feedback.

But when I thought about how people *actually behave*, I realized it might quietly break the whole loop.

> The moment you ask users to rate themselves, they stop flowing.  
> They start judging. Overthinking. Hesitating.

And when that happens, they do fewer mocks.

## The Real Goal: Make Feedback a Habit

MockJam wasn’t built to make people analyze themselves. It was built to help them *practice*.

- Get in.
- Speak your answer.
- Get feedback.
- Repeat.

That’s it.

Adding a self-rating step would’ve done the opposite:
- Created *decision fatigue* after each session.
- Made people feel like they were being tested - even by themselves.
- Reduced the number of mocks they’d do per week.

And in the long run, that meant less improvement.

## What I Focused On Instead

Rather than ask users to score themselves, I spent time improving the feedback system:

- Built a rubric that scores answers across 6 key dimensions (like goal clarity, user insight, and prioritization).
- Tuned the prompt to avoid generic praise - it calls out real mistakes.
- Made the tone encouraging, but specific.

This way, users *still* reflect - but through **external structure**, not internal doubt.

## I Might Add It One Day - But Not Yet

I’m not against self-reflection.

But tools shape behavior.

If I ever add self-scoring, it’ll be as part of a larger system - maybe to help users compare past performances or spot patterns across sessions.

Until then, I’m choosing flow over friction.

## Closing Thought

Sometimes, it’s not about what you build - it’s about what you choose *not* to.

This wasn’t a complex feature. But skipping it helped MockJam stay focused on what actually drives progress:

> Repetition. Momentum. Feedback.  
> Not overanalysis.
