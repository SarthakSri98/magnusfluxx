# Launching Dodo Kit: A New Era of Design Systems

When we set out to build Dodo Kit, we had one goal in mind: create a design system that developers would actually enjoy using. No more bloated components, no more fighting with styles, just pure, clean, and accessible components that work out of the box.

## The Vision

We wanted to create something that would:
- Be truly accessible by default
- Have minimal bundle size
- Support both light and dark modes seamlessly
- Be easy to customize without fighting the framework

## Key Features

### 1. Accessibility First
Every component is built with ARIA in mind. We don't just add aria-labels as an afterthought â€“ accessibility is baked into the core design.

### 2. Performance Focused
The entire system is tree-shakeable, meaning you only ship what you use. No more bloated bundles.

### 3. Developer Experience
We've focused heavily on making the API intuitive. Every component follows similar patterns, making it easy to learn and use.

## What's Next

We're already working on:
- More complex components
- Animation primitives
- Better documentation
- Community templates

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve Dodo Kit into the most developer-friendly design system out there.
