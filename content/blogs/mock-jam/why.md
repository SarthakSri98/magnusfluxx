# How I got the idea for building MockJam

When I decided to transition into product management, I wasn’t short on skills — but I was short on feedback.

- I had a strong technical foundation.
- I understood frameworks like **CIRCLES**, **RICE**, and **MoSCoW**.
- But I kept falling into the same traps:
  - Jumping straight to solutions.
  - Rambling instead of structuring my thoughts.
  - Struggling to speak clearly under pressure.

Reading wasn't enough. These habits needed to be rewired, and that meant *deliberate practice*.

## My First Attempts

I started small. Practiced on my own.

- Used **ChatGPT** to simulate product sense questions.
- Spoke my answers out loud — just like in real interviews.
- It caught a few patterns — especially when I skipped user thinking or lacked structure.

But there was a catch:
- **ChatGPT was often too polite.**
- I had to **manually remind it to act like a tough interviewer**.
- That meant re-pasting prompts, aligning tone, and constantly adjusting its behavior.

Over time, that friction added up.

I needed a way to make the loop seamless. No manual setup. No babysitting the AI. Started giving mocks with peers, started seeing improvement so I decided to give as many mocks as I can. But...

## The Real Problem

Mock interviews although a solution for a very big problem i.e. preparation for interviews, is still avoided by people. 

So, I decided to take this as a case study to solve. I started observing and talking to peers in the HelloPM community, floated a survey form, scanning slack groups and product subreddits and found some real pain points. I realised every single PM realised the importance of mocks just as me but there were multiple reasons they weren't giving mocks. Why?

- Hard to **find serious partners**.
- People felt **underprepared or nervous**.
- Feedback was often too **vague or sugar-coated** to be useful.
- They kept **running beind** other's calendars.

These weren’t technical problems.  
They were human ones, driven by hesitation, social dynamics, and inconsistent setups.

That’s where I saw an opportunity, not just to build a tool, but to **reduce friction in a loop that worked**. Cricketers have nets to practice, Engineers have leetcode, why not we product people have something to practice on?

## Building MockJam

I didn’t set out to build a full-fledged product. I just wanted to *solve my own problem fast*.

- Used **Cursor's agentic mode** to move quicker.
- Built the **frontend, backend, and deployment** myself.
- Leveraged past experience with **AI prompting and response control**.
- Delivered the MVP in **under 2 weeks**.

Then I became my own user, testing it on myself from day one.

## What Changed For Me

Practicing with MockJam started shaping my thinking.

- Every mock pushed me to **slow down and structure** my responses.
- The feedback loop helped me **break bad habits** and build better ones.
- Improving the product and improving myself started feeding into each other.

It wasn’t just helping me speak better, it was helping me *think* better and this product helped me to move from a builder's mindset to a product mindset.
