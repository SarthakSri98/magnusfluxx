# Not Everyone’s Ready to Mock - Why We Built the Library Section in MockJam

When I first built MockJam, the idea was simple:  
An AI-powered gym for product managers.  

You show up, get a real interview question, hit "Start Mock", speak your answer, and get instant feedback.  
It was meant to help people *practice actively*, not passively consume theory.

And for some users - it worked brilliantly.

But for many others, it didn’t work at all.  
They landed, hesitated... and bounced.

## ❌ The Friction I Overlooked

The core call-to-action - **“Start a Mock Interview”** - was demanding more than I realized.

It assumed the user:
- Felt mentally ready to be judged
- Knew what a decent PM answer even sounds like
- Could think aloud, structure their response, and perform on the spot

But for most early-stage PMs or career switchers, that’s terrifying.  
They want to *lurk*, *learn*, *absorb* - not perform right away.

MockJam was built like a gym.  
But most people don’t show up to a gym and immediately try deadlifting 200 kg.  
They walk around first. Watch others. Try the lighter machines.

## 💡 The Insight: Lurking is a Valid First Step

This was the mindset shift for me:  
> **Lurking isn't a problem - it's a stage. And we weren’t serving it.**

I started reviewing user recordings (or the absence of them), session drop-offs, and even feedback from friends.  
People didn’t want to quit. They just didn’t know where to *start*.

They didn’t want *less value* - they wanted *a lower-pressure way in*.

## 🛠️ The Iteration: Introducing the Library

To fix this, we built the **Library section** - a soft landing spot for users who aren’t ready to mock, but still want to improve.

Instead of forcing them to “perform,” we let them:
- **Explore real interview questions** from Meta, Google, Uber, Swiggy, etc.
- **Read structured rubrics** that show what interviewers are looking for
- **See full mock transcripts** with annotated answers (e.g. ✅ *"clarified the user"*, ✅ *"prioritized trade-offs"*)
- And **only then** decide if they want to mock the question themselves

Each blog-style post is based on a real mock interview conducted on MockJam.  
So it’s not theory - it’s what good actually looks like.

## 🔄 Product Thinking Behind It

This wasn’t just a UI improvement. It was a **product posture change**.  
Instead of treating everyone like they’re ready to be on stage, we created a backstage.

A few things I kept in mind:

- **User stage mapping**: Lurkers → Explorers → Performers  
- **No overwhelm**: Only 6–8 questions visible at once. We highlight “Question of the Day” or “Most Watched” to guide them.  
- **Built-in transition**: Every page has a **"Mock This Interview"** CTA - but it's optional, not forced.  
- **Familiar patterns**: It feels like a blog or content feed - something users are already comfortable consuming.

## 🎯 The Goal: Convert Quiet Browsers Into Confident Practitioners

The Library isn’t a distraction from the core value - it’s a bridge to it.

It helps users:
- Understand what “good” sounds like
- Build confidence quietly
- And eventually start practicing actively

In hindsight, this was less about adding a feature - and more about acknowledging a user truth:  
**Not everyone is ready. But most people want to be.**

And it’s our job to help them get there.
