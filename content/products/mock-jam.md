## Overview

### MockJam - AI-Powered Mock Interviews for Product Managers

**Problem:**  
Most aspiring PMs struggle to get real mock interview practice. Finding partners is hard, and feedback is often vague or sugar-coated. Worse — many users don’t feel ready to “perform” on command.

**How I’m fixing it:**  
**MockJam** gives users real product management questions, simulates the interview experience with AI, and provides structured, actionable feedback.  
To support users who aren’t ready to jump into a mock, we introduced a **Library** — a low-pressure space where they can explore real questions, rubrics, and annotated answers from featured mock interviews.

**What I learned:**  
Not everyone enters ready to perform. Designing for **user readiness stages** — from lurkers to explorers to performers — helped us reduce friction, increase engagement, and build trust with first-time users.
