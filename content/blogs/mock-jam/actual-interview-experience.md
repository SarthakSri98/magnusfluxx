# To Give the Actual Interview Experience

One of the first things I realized while practicing for PM interviews was this:

> **ChatGPT was too polite.**

Even when I gave average answers, it responded with:
> “Great start! Maybe you can add user pain points.”

That might feel nice. But it doesn’t help.  
In real interviews, you’re not getting soft nudges - you’re getting cut off. You’re getting challenged. You’re getting pressure-tested.

That’s what I wanted MockJam to feel like.

## Prompting Wasn’t the Hard Part

The hard part wasn’t making the AI *talk*.  
The hard part was **deciding what “good” looks like**.

I didn’t want vague comments.  
I wanted the AI to react like a **sharp, thoughtful PM** - someone in a product review, not a classroom.

So I spent time defining a real rubric - the kind I wish I had during prep:

- **Goal** - Did the candidate frame the right outcome?
- **User** - Do they deeply understand who they’re solving for?
- **Friction** - Can they uncover what’s actually broken?
- **Prioritization** - Are they making a clear bet?
- **Move** - Is their next step focused and decisive?
- **Metric** - Are they closing the loop with clarity?

## A System That Interrupts, Pushes, and Pressures

Every time I used MockJam, I improved the prompt.

I built logic for:
- When to evaluate, and when to hold back
- When to interrupt the candidate
- What kind of follow-up to ask if they’re spiraling or playing it safe
- How to balance encouragement with brutal honesty

At one point, I wrote:
> “Sometimes it should say - this feels like a deck, not a decision.”  
> “If someone’s avoiding a call, it should say - you're dodging the real move. What’s your bet?”

That became part of the tone layer.

## Because Real Feedback Changes You

I practiced with this prompt again and again.  
It didn’t just help me speak better. It helped me **think** better.

The AI wasn’t giving me grades.  
It was forcing me to reflect:
- Why was I being vague?
- What was I avoiding?
- Did I even commit to a direction?

That’s the real value. And honestly, it’s what changed my mindset from just solving questions to actually thinking like a PM.
