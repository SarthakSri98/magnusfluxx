TypeScript has evolved significantly, and with it, best practices have emerged to help developers write more maintainable and type-safe code. Let's explore the most important practices for 2024.

## Type Inference vs Explicit Types

TypeScript's type inference is powerful, but knowing when to use explicit types is crucial:

```typescript
// Let TypeScript infer simple types
const count = 0; // inferred as number
const message = 'Hello'; // inferred as string

// Be explicit with object types and function signatures
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function processUser(user: User): void {
  // ...
}
```

## The Power of Discriminated Unions

Discriminated unions are a powerful pattern for handling different states:

```typescript
type RequestState<T> = 
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: T }
  | { status: 'error'; error: Error };
```

## Using Generics Effectively

Generics make your code more reusable while maintaining type safety:

```typescript
function pick<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, keys: K[]): Pick<T, K> {
  const result = {} as Pick<T, K>;
  keys.forEach(key => {
    result[key] = obj[key];
  });
  return result;
}
```

## Modern TypeScript Features

Some newer TypeScript features that improve code quality:

1. **Template Literal Types**
2. **const Assertions**
3. **satisfies Operator**

## Conclusion

Following these practices will help you write more maintainable TypeScript code. Remember, the goal is to leverage TypeScript's type system to catch errors early while maintaining readable and maintainable code.
